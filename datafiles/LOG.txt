- Doom lock appearance is slightly better (gem is not invisible for half a second now)
- Fixed "matchless" typo

- You are now allowed to freely resize your game window. This will show up as "Custom" in the screen size option
- Removed debug character showing when typing an IP
- You can quickly insert custom quests now by the quest menu (only 1 insertion at a time for now). Also, from now on, your name will be credited when creating a custom quest
- Some internal changes on how quests are read for faster compiling. If you find any problems with the quests, please report them!
- Custom quests are now stored in a folder called CustomQuests, so if you don't see your custom quests, go to %appdata%/local/bej_temp_remaster and move all custom quests (named '0.ini', '1.ini' etc) to the CustomQuests folder (if there isn't a folder, make one yourself with the exact name)
- Replays, just like custom quests also have their own folder from now on called Replays. Same deal as above

- Fixed quest objective nospecialgems gameover bug
- Fixed quest menu scroll up
- Fixed quest editor backspace not resulting in deleting text and added a Main menu button in there
- Added a custom quest option in nospecials and nolightning to end the game when it happens. Otherwise it just resets all the stats back to 0.

=1.6=
Changes:

- Fixed minor error with the glow texture on lock appearances
- Made some small infoboxes in Online Lobby when hovering on the options
- Somehow I had broken bomb/doom/lock spawns but I fixed them now (not sure if that was broken in 1.5 anyway)

- Fixed Buyo Buyo gem image scale
- Fixed (I think) random hypercube creation not being able to move after spawning on a lock
- Fixed avalanche gem spawn freeze when hypercubes are lined up (it thinks it's a match)
- Avalanche gem spawn now takes in consideration if you have a hypercube
- Buyo Buyo now has 5 gem skins instead of 7
- Fixed Style being bigger than the Points
- Lightnings, novas and hypercubes now are more optimized in online. Now disconnecting due to bad connection is at minimal levels!
- Hypercube explosions now give Style points
- Added option in the settings.ini to remove Zen Sleeping and hiding the items (run zen mode at least once to make it appear in the file). Find it in appdata/local/bej_temp_remaster
- Fixed online ready button making the game start many times if spammed
- Added a 5 minute music version for Time Attack (basically extended the music, might improve it later on tho cuz there are some transitions that i dont like)

=1.4.6=
Changes:
- Added a Credits button in the main Menu
- Fixed (I think) a minor irritation when zen mode is hiding the game items, making the next swap unpredictable when everything re-appears
- Fixed a crash on bej2 type of quests where a 4-gem match explosion and creation at the same time would produce a hidden gem inside of it
- Updated credits messages (changed every instance of the phrase "Challenge Mode" to "Quests")
- Minor optimizations to texture pages
- Playing online is now dissallowed if you have debug mode enabled
- When typing an IP address, the IP text will be hidden for safety reasons (for example, when streaming)

=1.4.5=
Changes:
- When zen items are hidden for being idle for a long time, now they reappear when keyboard controls are being used (fixed invisible matching)
- Fixed the pixel interpolation being turned off at random occasions, making stuff pixelated and ugly

=1.4.4=
Changes:
- Lots of texture page optimizations (reduced from 21 to 10). This means much less memory usage and 20MB less of disk space, but might make some minor effects slightly less appealing or a little more cpu demanding, since they are using code functions instead of sprites for the effect to be done
- Removed leftover debug numbers in username creation
- Made small optimizations in Online gems (removed unused code from the enemy's gems)

=1.4.3=
Changes:
- Added an update check in the main menu (Requires internet connection)
- Fixed a crash with the Undo button in quests
- Hypecube animation now gets slow-mo'ed too when you Replay a combo
- Added an option in settings.ini to disable discord rich presence in case it can't be executed for some reason. Specifically, if you want to disable rich presence, go to C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\bej_temp_remaster, open settings.ini with notepad, go to the [Settings] section, and set "discord_allowed" from 1 to 0.

=1.4.2=
Changes:
- Fixed an error with the hypercube softlock algorithm (it would produce an error if there were gaps in the board if u spammed swapping in zen mode and having no moves)
- Fixed gameover error crash (never met that error myself, but i made it at least not crash)
- Potentially fixed Bomb Wheel Spinner conditions weirdness (you would win with red skull) (need more testing)
- Potentially fixed Hybrid multiple selection and diagonal swap bug (need more testing)
- Returned "Excellent"+ compliments for any 6+ gem matches (they had been accidentally nerfed after changing the gem point base values, and a 7-gem match would just return "good"). This means that every 6+ gem match will produce a replay button
- Zenify value is finally being autosaved now. This should not break the previous save you have
- Bomb spawning algorithm is MUCH better now. Instead of getting a random chance that a bomb will spawn after the TurnsToSpawn condition is 0 (I chose randomness so that the bomb will not spawn always on the first bottom gem spawn), I made that chance depend on how many gaps the board has, so the bomb will spawn NO MATTER WHAT and it doesn't always have to be the very first spawned gem (previously it might have not even spawned). This might make Arcade slightly harder near the end of the levels, because now bombs will TRULY spawn every 1 move

=1.4.1=
Changes:
- Made the locking animation a little smoother
- Added Hybrid movement (Keyboard WASD works while playing with mouse)

=1.4=
Changes:
- Randomized Backdrops shaders in Online so you won't only have that green backdrop

- Made chat typing more responsive and better
- You can now change gamepad binds

=1.3=
Changes:
- Added music in Possible Moves last 2 quests
- Some controller and keyboard support is here. Specifically, you can now play any gamemode with a gamepad/keyboard, however clickable buttons and menu are not working without mouse. More features will come later on
- Now pressing Undo/Reset will also undo/reset more elements (multiplier, challenge bonus etc)
- Fixed a hypercube bug in Avalanche Online
- Fixed Crash when pressing Reset in a bej2 puzzle type mode when coals were present
- Fixed board text in custom quest editor appearing even when gem spawn is dissallowed
- Updated rich presence for Countdown Mode
- Challenge bonus in custom quests will now produce only the skins that are available for that quest

=1.2=

=beta v7b=
Changes:
- Online Multiplayer is now available with Time attack only for the moment! (Please be patient for Avalanche and Lightning later on)
- Online Twist mode is also available!
- Nova+ creation/explosion points have been reduced in order to make gameplay slower on arcade mode. This could mean broken replays in blitz mode
- Blitz Replay menu is now completely ready and can fit as many replays as you want!
- Extended the Zen music using one more track from Yalek

b:

- Made style points correct now

Note: In the quest menu, you might still have the default description "Create custom challenge" instead of "Create custom quest". This is due to previous writings in the files and I can't fix that

=beta v4=
Changes:
- Made score text appear on top of gems (can be turned off in options if it's too distracting for you)
- Made changes to the points system, especially septanovas and octanovas that give more points now (3000 and 5000 respectively). This might mean that some blitz replays will show wrong stats now.
- Fixed compact mode's bad points. A 4-gem match would previously give the same points as a 3-gem match
- Made level completion better
- Made Buyo Buyo much smoother in its movement. Also added levels properly.
- Buyo Buyo is now available in "Secret" gamemodes (and is unlocked)
- Stats can be seen from menu now. If stats seem broken (eg: title says "Untitled") I suggest you deleting the stats_*.ini files from appdata/local/bej_temp_remaster
