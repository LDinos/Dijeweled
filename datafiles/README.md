=FAQ=
Q: My game runs slowly. Help?
A: If your PC isn't strong enough to play the game with more than 60 FPS, try Disabling VSync and Enhanced Graphics in the options. It's also not recommended to play Online with a slow-mo paced Dijeweled.

Q: Game does a weird flickering effect when igniting special gems!
A: Try disabling Magnification FX from options. Sorry! I am still bad with shaders...

Q: I get an error at the very beginning, not being able to run external DLL for Discord!
A: This is a rare problem with rich presence. You can fix this by turning off rich presence of Dijeweled by going on C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\bej_temp_remaster\settings.ini and in the [Settings] section, change "discord_allowed" from 1 to 0

Q: I love your game so much that I wanna throw money at you! How can I do that?
A: https://www.paypal.me/ldinos

Q: My game crashed and I got an error. Unistalled 0/10.
A: If you get an error, please contact me on discord LDinos#6531 or in the server http://discord.gg/jSj2uKB and try to explain it to me. I will do my best to fix it for the next versions :)

Q: Game is slow for me (LAG counter is inconsinstent), even though I have more than 60 fps!
A: Try going to Task Manager -> Right click on my game -> Set priority -> Realtime

Q: I need general information about this game. Is there a wikia about it?
A: Yes! Check out https://bejeweled.fandom.com/wiki/Dijeweled_Remastered

Q: DUDE YOU SHOULD TOTALLY ADD (THIS) (THIS) AND (THAT).
A: Thanks for your suggestion but don't expect too many changes or new gamemodes. I have a life you know. Actually I don't but whatever, you get what i mean

Q: Why is it called "Remastered"?
A: I first started this project in 2016 by using Gamemaker for the first time. After a while, I improved my code skills a lot, and realized that my game was very heavy on unoptimized code. That's when I decided to start again from scratch, thus making this game. It's now called Dijeweled Remastered

Q: I made a custom Quest that I want to share with someone. How can I do that?
A: If you go to Appdata/Local/bej_temp_remaster, you can find some .ini files with numerals (eg "0.ini", "1.ini"). These are your custom quests which you can send to whoever you want. Then the other player will need to put these in the same folder. You can rename them too if you don't want to replace some already existing files, as long as they are just numbers.

Q: I want to share a blitz replay with someone. How can I do that?
A: Same as previous answer, but this time we are talking about files that are .rep extensions.

Q: I want to delete my stats, and generally my whole Dijeweled profile. How can I do that?
A: Delete the bej_temp_remaster folder in AppData/Local

Q: What's your youtube?
A: Weird question to ask since you probably found this game by my youtube but here it is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYPI0C8qZPQ1uA9-xw1VBg

Q: Favorite pony?
A: Rarity


Have fun in-game!
