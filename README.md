### What's this?
Dijeweled Remastered is a fan-made recreation of Popcap's / EA franchise called Bejeweled. It focuses on bringing the exciting usual mechanics of the previous games, while also bringing some new stuff to the table like **Multiplayer, new gems, and new Gamemodes!**

Dijeweled is being worked on for over 4+ years now, starting from "Dijeweled", then "Dijeweled Multiplayer" and finally Dijeweled Remastered
